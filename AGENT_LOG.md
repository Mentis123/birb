# Project Log

## Current Steps
- Review existing Three.js gliding capsule scene to verify visual fidelity and interaction responsiveness.
- Maintain alignment between HTML structure, module imports, and animation loop behavior.

## Current Issues
- Need regular validation that the capsule's glide path and controls remain responsive after changes.
- Lack of structured documentation for iterative scene refinements and planned enhancements.

## Execution Steps
- Perform manual run-throughs in a local server environment to confirm animation, lighting, and resizing are stable.
- Capture observations, regressions, or visual artifacts for each iteration in this log before shipping updates.
- Update this document whenever new tasks arise or issues are resolved to keep progress transparent.

## Future Roadmap
- Introduce automated sanity checks (e.g., linting or lightweight visual diffs) to accompany manual verification.
- Explore expanding the scene with environmental elements (e.g., skybox or terrain) while preserving performance.
- Document reusable utilities for material presets and motion patterns to accelerate future scene variations.
